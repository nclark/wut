# CLAUDE.md - Wu-Tang Timer Enhancement Progress

## Project Overview
Enhanced a basic Wu-Tang themed countdown timer into the most lit, most Wu-Tang, most visually ridiculous timer experience ever created.

## What Was Done

### üî• Major Enhancements Added
1. **Wu-Tang Member Modes**: 9 different member themes with unique colors
2. **Visual Effects System**: Permanent rainbow colors, emoji rain, screen shake, strobe effects
3. **Enhanced Particle System**: Emojis, spinning symbols, beat-pulsing particles
4. **Wu-Tang Logo Animations**: ASCII art logos bouncing around screen with toggle control
5. **40+ Wu-Tang Quotes**: Expanded quote collection with floating animations
6. **Interactive Controls**: Real-time effect toggling during countdown
7. **Custom Time Input**: Enter any countdown duration
8. **Epic Finale**: 300-particle rainbow explosion when timer completes

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- **Fixed Critical Crash**: Prevented `rand.Intn(0)` panic in screen shake
- **Performance Optimization**: Slowed down frame rate from 50ms to 100ms
- **Reduced Overwhelm**: Fewer particles, slower movements, calmer defaults
- **Better Visibility**: Longer particle lifespans, reduced spawn rates
- **Improved UX**: Effects start disabled, can be enabled incrementally
- **Fixed Toggle Issues**: All effects now work properly with visible status indicators
- **Rainbow Core Feature**: Made rainbow colors permanent for maximum lit-ness

### üìÅ Files Modified/Created
